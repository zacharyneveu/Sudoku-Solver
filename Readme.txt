This program reads the contents of a Sudoku board from a text file.  Part A
offers the user the ability to enter and clear values and displays when the
puzzle is solved.  Part B solves the Sudoku puzzle using a recursive algorithm
with backtracking, along with "human" optimizations to eliminate recursive
function calls.

This code was developed for Introduction to Engineering Algorithms at
Northeastern University, taught by Mi Ningfang.
